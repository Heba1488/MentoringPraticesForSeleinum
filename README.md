#  Selenium & JUnit Learning Project

This repository documents my hands-on journey into the world of **automated web testing** using **Selenium WebDriver** and **JUnit**.  
It’s not just a collection of code — it’s a practical lab where I experiment, learn, and refine my skills in building reliable, maintainable, and efficient test automation frameworks.

Whether you’re a beginner exploring Selenium for the first time or an experienced tester looking for structured examples, this project offers real-world test cases, best practices, and step-by-step implementations that bridge theory with practice.
